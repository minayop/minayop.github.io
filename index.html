<h1>Mina Young Pedersen <small>(she/her)</small></h1>

<h3>alt. names Mina Young, Mina Young P., 楊明娜</h3>

<p>I am a logician, mathematician, philosopher, writer, translator, film critic, organist,
  Esperanto enthusiast and devoted backgammon player. </p>

<p> My academic interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and philosophy: ranging from
  the philosophy of mathematics to logic and formal epistemology.

  Currently, I am doing a PhD in Information Science in the Logic & AI research group at the University of Bergen,
  where I use modal logic to research mathematical properties behind social phenomena
  such as social bots, echo chambers and group polarization. I am particularly interested in agents that
  act unexpectedly, or try to take advantage of the system for their own gain.
