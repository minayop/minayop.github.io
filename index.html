<h3>About Me</h3>
  
<p>I am a logician, hobby organist,
  esperantist and devoted backgammon player. 
  I also occasionally write and translate texts about film or popular science.</p>

<p> My academic interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and philosophy, ranging from
  the philosophy of mathematics to logic and formal epistemology. 
  I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://humane-ai.nl/" target="_blank">Research Priority Area in Human(e) AI</a> at 
  the University of Amsterdam, where I am affiliated with the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC).</p>

<p> Before I started my job in Amsterdam, I completed a PhD in Information Science in the Logic & AI research group at the University of Bergen, under the supervision of Marija Slavkovik, Thomas Ågotnes and Sonja Smets. The thesis was about using modal logic to research agents in multi-agent systems who act unexpectedly, or try to take advantage of the system for their own gain. You can read my thesis <a href="https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/11250/3151733" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
